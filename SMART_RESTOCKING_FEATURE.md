# Smart Grocery Restocking Feature

## Overview

The Smart Grocery Restocking feature is an AI-powered system that learns from your purchasing patterns and automatically suggests when to restock groceries before you run out. This feature helps ensure you never run out of essential items and can plan your grocery shopping more efficiently.

## How It Works

### 1. Purchase Tracking
- The system automatically tracks your grocery purchases when you add items to your cart
- It records purchase dates, quantities, and consumption patterns
- Currently tracks items in categories: Groceries, Health & Beauty, and Household

### 2. AI-Powered Predictions
- Uses machine learning algorithms to predict when you'll run out of items
- Learns from your actual consumption patterns to improve accuracy over time
- Considers factors like:
  - Historical purchase frequency
  - Quantity purchased
  - Time between purchases
  - Product category (different items have different consumption rates)

### 3. Smart Notifications
- Sends timely notifications before items run out
- Prioritizes notifications based on urgency:
  - **High Priority**: Items that will run out in 3 days or less
  - **Medium Priority**: Items that will run out in 4-7 days
  - **Low Priority**: Items that will run out in 8-14 days
